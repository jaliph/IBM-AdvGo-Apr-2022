Go
    Higher Order Functions
    Duck typing (implicitly implemented interfaces)
    Concurrency


Concurrency
    NEVER ASSUME the following
        1. the sequence of execution of your goroutines
        2. the time taken for a goroutine to complete its job

    Channels
        Receive operation is ALWAYS a blocking operation
        A Send operation is blocked until a receive operation on the channel is initiated (non-buffered Channel)
        In a buffered channel, the send operation will be successful even when a receive operation is not initiated
            coz, the data will be kept in the buffer

    Modify the demo-15.go in such way that  the "genEvenNos" will keep generating even numbers until the user hits the ENTER key
    NOTE : Do not accept user input in the genEvenNos() function

GRPC
    protocol buffers
    http2
    multi language support
    Communication Patterns
        Request & Response
        Client Streaming (multiple requests & one response)
        Server Streaming (one request & multiple responses)
        Bi-directional Streaming (multiple requests & multiple responses)
        
Process
    Define Schema (in protocol buffers)
        Service Contract
        Operation Contract
        Data Contract
    Generate code (protoc)
        Proxy (client)
        Stub (server)
    Implement the Service Contract
        Service Implementation
    Host the server
