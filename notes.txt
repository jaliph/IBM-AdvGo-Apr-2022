    Concurrency


Concurrency
    NEVER ASSUME the following
        1. the sequence of execution of your goroutines
        2. the time taken for a goroutine to complete its job

    Channels
        Receive operation is ALWAYS a blocking operation
        A Send operation is blocked until a receive operation on the channel is initiated (non-buffered Channel)
        In a buffered channel, the send operation will be successful even when a receive operation is not initiated
            coz, the data will be kept in the buffer
